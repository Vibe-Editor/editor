Video editing software designed for motion effects and versatility.

In addition to essential features like basic cut editing, animation, sound mixing, external library extensions, project management, and text editing, our software offers a wide range of powerful tools.

It also supports layer-based editing, which differs from traditional track-based editing. This approach makes it easier to apply multiple effects to individual assets, providing greater flexibility and creative control.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> ðŸ“¢ <strong>Currently, the 0.4.x version is being refactored.</strong> It can be a little unstable.
