# Testing Persistent Generation States

## 🧪 Test Cases for Image Generation Fix

### ✅ **Issue Fixed**: Image generation no longer refreshes entire flow

**Problem**: When an image was generated, `refreshProjectData()` was called, causing:
- Entire flow to be recreated from API data
- Other generating nodes to disappear
- Loss of temporary generation states

**Solution**: Removed unnecessary `refreshProjectData()` calls from:
- `handleImageGeneration()` (line 1991)
- `handleVideoGeneration()` (line 2156)

### 🔬 **Test Scenarios**:

1. **Multiple Image Generation**:
   ```
   Start: Generate 3 images simultaneously
   Expected: All 3 show loading states
   Before Fix: First completion would remove other loading nodes
   After Fix: All 3 continue showing until each completes
   ```

2. **Mixed Generation Types**:
   ```
   Start: Generate 1 concept + 2 images + 1 video
   Expected: All show loading states independently
   Before Fix: Image completion would remove other loading states
   After Fix: Each completes independently without affecting others
   ```

3. **Page Refresh During Generation**:
   ```
   Start: Generate 2 images
   Action: Refresh page while generating
   Expected: Both loading nodes restored
   Before Fix: Worked, but completion would still cause issues
   After Fix: Restored nodes complete independently
   ```

### 🎯 **Key Changes**:

1. **Removed Refresh Calls**:
   ```javascript
   // REMOVED: await refreshProjectData();
   // Nodes are updated directly via setNodes()
   ```

2. **Direct Node Updates**:
   ```javascript
   setNodes(prevNodes => prevNodes.map(node => {
     if (node.id === imageNode.id) {
       return { ...node, data: { ...generatedImageData } };
     }
     return node;
   }));
   ```

3. **Smarter Restoration**:
   ```javascript
   // Only restore after initial data is loaded
   useEffect(() => {
     if (allProjectData && Object.keys(allProjectData).length > 0) {
       setTimeout(() => restoreGenerationStates(), 500);
     }
   }, [allProjectData, restoreGenerationStates]);
   ```

### 🚀 **Benefits**:
- ✅ Multiple generations can run simultaneously
- ✅ No interference between different generation types
- ✅ Persistent states remain intact during page refresh
- ✅ Better performance (no unnecessary API calls)
- ✅ Smoother user experience

### 🔍 **How to Test**:
1. Start multiple image generations
2. Verify all show loading states
3. Wait for first to complete
4. Confirm others remain in loading state
5. Refresh page during generation
6. Verify all loading states are restored
7. Wait for completion - should work without refresh
